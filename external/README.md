# `external/`
This directory is not required.

The `external/` directory is reserved for embedding of external projects. Each
embedded project should occupy a single subdirectory of `external/`.

`external/` should not contain files other than those required by tooling.

This directory may be automatically populated, either partially or completely,
by tools (eg. `git` submodules) as part of a build process. In this case,
projects must declare the auto-populated subdirectories as ignored by relevant
source control systems.

Subdirectories of `external/` should not be modified as part of regular project
development. Subdirectories should remain as close to their upstream source as
possible.
