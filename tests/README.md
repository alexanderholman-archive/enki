# `tests/`

This directory is not required.

The `tests/` directory is reserved for source files related to (non-unit) tests
for the project.

The structure and layout of this directory is not prescribed by this document.

A project which can be embedded in another project (such as via
`external/`), must disable its `tests/` directory if it can detect that it
is being built as an embedded sub-project.

Project maintainers must provide a way for consumers to disable the compilation
and running of tests, especially for the purpose of embedding.
