# `tools/`

This directory is not required.

The `tools/` directory is designated for holding extra scripts and tools related
to developing and contributing to the project. For example, turn-key build
scripts, linting scripts, code-generation scripts, test scripts, or other tools
that may be useful to a project develop.

The contents of this directory should not be relevant to a project consumer.
